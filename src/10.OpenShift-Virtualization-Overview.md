1) OpenShift Virtualization - OpenShift managed KVM
=================================================

What is OpenShift Virtualization
--------------------------------

### OpenShift Virtualization

- A feature of the OpenShift container platform, based on the open-source KubeVirt project.
- Manage Virtual Machines into containerized workloads.
- Develop, manage and deploy VMs side-by-side with containers and serverless on one platform: OpenShift.

### What is KubeVirt?

- Open source project that makes it possible to run virtual machines in a Kubernetes-managed container platform.
- Delivers container-native virtualization by leveraging KVM, the Linux Kernel hypervisor, within a Kubernetes container.
- Provides services like those associated with traditional virtualization platforms, providing the best of both mature virtualization management technology and Kubernetes container orchestration.

How are OpenShift Virtualization images built
----------------------------------------------

### What images does OpenShift Virtualization support?

- OpenShift images are the same kind of images used by KVM / qemu / qcow2 - and are build
in a similar way to OpenStack or RHV images.
- Can also import RHV / VMware images, will use `qemu-img` convert behind the scenes to convert them to RAW and prepare them for OpenShift Virtualization.

### Image Format

- Only RAW and QCOW2 formats are supported disk types for the container image registry. QCOW2 is recommended for reduced image size.
- `virt-sparsify` to help 'compress' the image (sparsify).
- Images can be compressed with `xz` or `gzip`.

### Additional image requirements

- The **QEMU guest agent** is a daemon that runs on the virtual machine and passes information to the host about the virtual machine, users, file systems, and secondary networks.
- **VirtIO drivers** are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows virtual machines to run in OpenShift Virtualization.
- **cloud-init** lets OpenShift customize the image after provisioning - such as setting the Hostname, authorized SSH keys or running a custom script.
- Security patches and your configuration.

Install OpenShift Virtualization using an Operator

### Install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator and create a cluster

OpenShift Virtualization can be installed on any OpenShift cluster, using the Operator Hub.

- Install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator (2.4 or higher)
- Create a OpenShift Virtualization Operator Deployment: `kubevirt-hyperconverged` cluster on the Bare Metal node(s).

### Create a new project namespace

```bash
oc new-project virtual-machines
```

You can now create Virtual Machines by clicking on Workloads > Virtualization.

Virtual Machine Types
---------------------

### Ephemeral

- When using a `ephemeral` storage volume type, or `containerDisk`.
- The ephemeral image is created when the virtual machine starts and stores all writes locally. The ephemeral image is discarded when the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. The backing volume (PVC) is not mutated in any way.

### Persistent (persistentVolumeClaim)

- When using a `persistentVolumeClaim`
- Attaches an available PV to a virtual machine. Attaching a PV allows for the virtual machine data to persist between sessions.
- Importing an existing virtual machine disk into a PVC by using CDI and attaching the PVC to a virtual machine instance is the recommended method for importing existing virtual machines into OpenShift Container Platform.

**Note** CDI: Containerized Data Importer.

CDI: Containerized Data Importer Overview
-----------------------------------------

### [CDI](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer) Function

- persistent storage management add-on for Kubernetes. Uses `qemu-img` to manipulate disk images.
- provides a declarative way to build Virtual Machine Disks on PVCs for Kubevirt VMs.
- provides a way to populate PVCs with VM images or other data upon creation.
- data can come from different sources: a URL, a container registry, another PVC (clone), or an upload from a client.
- CDI will automatically decompress and convert the file from qcow2 to raw format if needed. It will also resize the disk to use all available space.

### Import from URL

This method is selected when you create a DataVolume with an http source. Supports basic authentication (secret) and custom TLS certificates (ConfigMap).

### Import from container registry

When a DataVolume has a registry source CDI will populate the volume with a Container Disk downloaded from the given image URL.
