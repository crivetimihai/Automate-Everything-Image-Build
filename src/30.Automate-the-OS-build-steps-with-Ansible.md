3) Automate the OS build steps with Ansible

### Considerations

- Do we need to have this always available?
- Create, build and tear down the build host on demand - will also reduce costs.
- Are we build images for other hypervisors? For example, we can install VMware workstation and build VMware images as well.

Setting up the build host on demand with Ansible
-------------------------------------------------


### Using an Ansible collection to install Virtualization Tools

- Created a Ansible collection for various virtualization tools (KVM, VMware, VirtualBox, etc).
- Collections make maintaining, publishing and testing roles easier.
- A simple example on how such a role can be used is listed below.
- This will install KVM, VMware, Packer and Vagrant on our build host.

### Install the Ansible collection

```yaml
pip install --upgrade ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install \
  crivetimihai.virtualization
``````

### Run the playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i localhost, playbook.yml \
  -e "vmware_workstation_license_key='...'" \
  -e "ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3"
```

### playbook.yaml

```yaml
- name: setup a virtualization environment
  hosts: all
  connection: local
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - role: crivetimihai.virtualization.kvm
    - role: crivetimihai.virtualization.vmware
    - role: crivetimihai.virtualization.packer
    - role: crivetimihai.virtualization.vagrant
```

What's inside the KVM role?
---------------------------

### vars/main.yaml

```yaml
redhat_packages:
  - policycoreutils-python-utils
  - qemu-kvm
  - qemu-img
  - libvirt
  - libvirt-client
  - python3-libvirt
  - libvirt-nss
  - libguestfs-tools
  - virt-install
  - virt-top
  - genisoimage
```

### tasks/install_RedHat.yml
```yaml
- name: install RedHat packages
  package:
    name: "{{ redhat_packages }}"
    state: present
  become: yes
```

Installing the correct VM tools
-------------------------------

Automate the installation of the correct 'VM' tools (KVM, VMware, VirtualBox, etc) based on the detected hypervisor.

### tasks/main.yaml

```yaml
# VMware
- include: VMware.yml
  when: ansible_virtualization_type == "vmware"

# KVM
- include: KVM.yml
  when: ansible_virtualization_type == "kvm"
```

### tasks/KVM.yml

```yaml
- name: install KVM tools packages
  package:
    name: "{{ packages_kvm_tools }}"
    state: present
  become: yes
```
