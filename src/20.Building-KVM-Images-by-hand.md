2) Build KVM images by hand - what are we automating?
====================================================

Architectural Decisions and Image Build considerations
------------------------------------------------------

### AD001: Build from scratch (kickstart / sysprep) every time?

- Do we want to rebuild the golden image every time, or do we create a major release build?
- Post-install steps are based on existing golden image (major release).
- Ansible used for post-install steps and parametrization (update the image, secure it, perform various post-install steps).
- Additional 'layers' for middleware or product installs.

### AD002: Clean builds or image conversion?

- When building multi-platform images (ex: VMware, KVM, OpenStack) - do we convert images, or use the right hypervisor for every build?

### AD003: What goes into post-provisioning scripts (ex: cloud-init)

- How much do we want to delegate to cloud-init?
- For example, do we want to bake in the security, patches and compliance in the golden image, or trigger it post provisioning?
- Triggering it after provisioning can be slow, consume bandwidth and expose the image during the update process.
